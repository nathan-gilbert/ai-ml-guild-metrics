Is our MLs learning? üòè

## Experiment Setup

Tools for training better models.

- Dataset division (training, testing, tuning)
- Cross Validation

## Experiment Effectiveness

How do you even measure 'better'?

- Accuracy
- Recall / Precision / F-measure
- Domain Specific Accuracy Measures
  - Machine Translation
  - Clustering
  - Image Processing

## Running the notebooks

- `python3 -m venv venv` create a python virtual environment
- `source venv/bin/activate.[bat|sh|fish|csh|ps1]` run the right activate script for your shell
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` install the dependencies
- `jupyter notebook` run the notebooks
